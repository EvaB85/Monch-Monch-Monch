##Planning:
Once we were assigned this project and given the requirements, I started planning right away. My first step was to come up with three levels of ideas. A dream idea, a middle of the road yet challenging idea, and a basic idea of the game. While I put this into pseudo code and wireframing/drawings I realized the idea I liked best may have been a bit above my JS level at the moment. I understood while doing this project I would learn a lot more and get to look at all the resources we were handed and more. I also knew this might have been a time where I would easily get distracted reading of all the possible animation and css styling I could incorporate in my game. With all this in mind, during the first two days of work I drew out the wireframe, studied some javascript, and wrote out the pseudo code for my initial game idea. I committed to the characters first day but had trouble finding good transparent images for my game. Decided to switch it to an adorable blue monster but then switched back since I searched again for Cookie Monster and Oscar the Grouch and successfully sound which ones I wanted.



##Starting Game:

I started my game by placing the background image and character images on the screen. I put together a quick html game board and title just to jog my mind to think of how I wanted it all to look or do. I am a visual learner and as much as I knew pseudo code is important, just laying out a board which characters and styling them a bit would make my mind think like a user. I had trouble reverting back to thinking like the user instead of how I would load this page and be interactive with with it. I will go in depth on why this made me code better. ***adjust grammar here
